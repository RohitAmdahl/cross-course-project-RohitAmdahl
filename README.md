## Description
I gathered design inspiration from pictures, created an inspiration board, and developed personas. I installed Hotjar for insights, and designed layouts and wireframes, progressing from low to high fidelity and prototypes. I implemented the designs into WordPress, set up products, made API calls, and conducted usability tests for a better user experience. Ensured responsiveness for the website.

## logo and slogan
We got a logo and slogan, but since this website is going to be designed by me so I just thought to do as I like to do. i edited and gave new design in PHOTOSHOP and changed the Slogan 
Slogen is on the pages it says Choose your style.
